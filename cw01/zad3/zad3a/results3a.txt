Wyniki uzyskane dla kazdego rodzaju biblioteki sa bardzo do siebie zblizone,
roznice dla poszczegolnych wynikow sa nieznaczne.

Wynika to z faktu, ze glownie obciazajaca byla wykonywana funkcja find,
a wybor biblioteki z ktorej korzystam nie ma praktycznie
zadnego znaczenia dla szybkosci wykonywanych operacji.

Czasy tworzenia blokow pamieci i ich usuwania sa bardzo nieznaczne,
praktycznie rowne zeru dla kazdego przypadku.
