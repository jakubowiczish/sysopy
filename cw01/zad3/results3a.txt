Wyniki uzyskane dla każdego rodzaju biblioteki są bardzo do siebie zbliżone,
różnice dla poszczególnych wyników są nieznaczne.


Wynika to z faktu, że obciążająca była głównie wykonywana funkcja find,
a wybór biblioteki z której korzystam nie ma praktycznie
żadnego znaczenia dla szybkości wykonywanych operacji.

Czasy tworzenia bloków pamięci i ich usuwania są bardzo nieznaczne, praktycznie równe zeru dla każdego przypadku.
